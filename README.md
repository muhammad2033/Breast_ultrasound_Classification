# Breast_ultrasound_Classification


Breast ultrasound classification with ML involves training CNN models using Keras on labeled datasets to distinguish between benign and malignant abnormalities. After achieving high accuracy, a Streamlit application is developed for easy deployment, providing clinicians with accurate predictions on ultrasound images for clinical validation.
